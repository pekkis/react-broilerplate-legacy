An application Bootstrap
=========================

OBS! This is legacy! [Here be current stuff](https://github.com/pekkis/react-broilerplate-project). Started to modularize this shit a while ago...

An application broilerplate I use and vampirize to start new projects.
Maintaining it seems to be a full-time job. Thanks, Obama!

Different branches hold different stuff. Master holds "current" stuff
(obsoleted yesterday).

My goal is to keep some "copy-paste and cry a bit" level updatability when stuff
evolves. I now have like 5+ projects that "share" this stuff.

Pull requests are accepted. If you vampirize this, vampirize something back
please! :D

Use as you wish, but still read the license from LICENSE.
